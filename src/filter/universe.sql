-- Stage 2: size filter for the buyout universe.
--
-- Executed by src/filter/universe.py, which registers two views before running this file:
--   candidate_companies  Active companies whose last accounts were FULL, GROUP or MEDIUM (Stage 1a)
--   accounts_wide        one row per filed period, consolidated figures preferred (Stage 1b)
-- and binds the named parameters below from config.yaml (block `target`):
--   $universe_turnover_min_gbp, $universe_employees_min, $universe_employees_max
--   $rank_turnover_min_gbp, $ebitda_early_floor_gbp
--   $exclude_account_categories, $exclude_sic
--   $computed_at
--
-- Output: one row per candidate company, whether or not it passes, with the latest accounts row
-- joined on, the prior period for growth, an EBITDA proxy, one boolean per rule and
-- exclusion_reason (first failing rule) or NULL. A FULL or GROUP filer with no parsed accounts is
-- `provisional`: it cannot be a small company, so it is carried as size-unverified until the
-- document API read lands (src/ingest/accounts_api.py).
